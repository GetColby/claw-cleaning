AI-booked apartment cleaning in San Francisco. $40/hour, Saturdays and Sundays, 8 AM to 6 PM PT, SF addresses only. The whole service is built to be driven by an LLM on the customer's behalf.

## Connect via MCP (recommended, zero-install)

## What the server does

Four tools over MCP, all for booking an SF weekend apartment cleaning:

- `check_availability` — list open weekend slots (Sat/Sun, 8am–6pm PT)
- `initiate_booking` — start a booking; returns a Stripe checkout URL or charges a saved card
- `check_booking_status` — list a customer's bookings by email
- `force_checkout_booking` — force a fresh checkout URL (e.g., after a card decline)

## Other integration paths

- **Claude Code plugin** — bundles the MCP connector + the `apartment-cleaning` skill, zero local binary. See [`plugin/`](plugin/).
- **Skill** — `openclaw install apartment-cleaning` or `hermes install apartment-cleaning`. The skill drives the MCP server above — no local binary required. See [`skill/apartment-cleaning/SKILL.md`](skill/apartment-cleaning/SKILL.md).
- **CLI** — `npm install -g claw-cleaning` then `claw-cleaning availability`, `claw-cleaning book`, `claw-cleaning status`. See [`cli/`](cli/).
